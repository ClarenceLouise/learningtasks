                <br>Thank you for your interest in us! We, the team, are glad that you took interest in our website. We hope that we touched your hearts and changed your minds about other people.
                Our vision is to build a better future not just for us, but for everyone in this world. We started this campaign years ago when our hearts were moved by other peoples story.
                Since then, the group has decided to commit and fight for the people who don't have the wealth and power, all because society separated them from the rest. Once again, thank you for supporting us
                and taking the time to read our website.</br>
